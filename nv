Is default-constructible, copy-constructible, copy-assignable and destructible	X a;
X b(a);
b = a;
Can be compared for equivalence using the equality/inequality operators
(meaningful when both iterator values iterate over the same underlying sequence).	a == b
a != b
Can be dereferenced as an rvalue (if in a dereferenceable state).	*a
a->m
For mutable iterators (non-constant iterators):
Can be dereferenced as an lvalue (if in a dereferenceable state).	*a = t
Can be incremented (if in a dereferenceable state).
The result is either also dereferenceable or a past-the-end iterator.
Two iterators that compare equal, keep comparing equal after being both increased.
++a
a++
*a++
Can be decremented (if a dereferenceable iterator value precedes it).
--a
a--
*a--
Supports the arithmetic operators + and - between an iterator and an integer value, or subtracting an iterator from another.	a + n
n + a
a - n
a - b
Can be compared with inequality relational operators (<, >, <= and >=).	a < b
a > b
a <= b
a >= b
Supports compound assignment operations += and -=	a += n
a -= n
Supports the offset dereference operator ([])	a[n]
